#Metis schema library
This module replaces the previous corelib-edm definitions.  
The java classes are auto-generated during mvn install.      
The java classes will similarly not be committed on the repository and should be generated during the maven build.  
The Schemas are coming from the corelib library but they should eventually be merged with the schemas that exist in the metis-validation library.
