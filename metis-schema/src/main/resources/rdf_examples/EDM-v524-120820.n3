=======
Changes between EDM-v524-120820.owl
and EDM-v523-120123.owl
=======
1. edm:isShownAt made a sub-property of edm:hasView
2. added edm:begin and edm:end and their mappings to CRM
3. added owl:Class declarations added for compatibility with some OWL-DL reasoners (feedback from Pedro Szekely, ISI)
4. added "of" at the end of the label for edm:isNextInSequence
5. added vocabulary metadata to follow Linked Open Vocabularies (http://lov.okfn.org/) and ADMS (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/release/100) guidelines
6. removed a domain axiom on edm:hasMet
7. added edm:collectionName and edm:europeanaProxy

=======
Remaining TODOs for EDM-v524-120820.owl
=======
- change FRBR namespace and mappings using FRBRoo namespace or http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/5.html
- add Martin's mapping to FRBR(oo) for edm:incorporates (equivalent to crm:R14F.incorporates) and edm:WebResource (subclass of F24 Publication Expression)
- try to capture formal cardinality constraints resulting from "Obligation and Occurrence" documentation, which should be attached to non-EDM constructs (esp. ore:Aggregation)
- continue adding documentation values (skos:scopeNote, skos:example, etc, according to 1.), starting from edm:InformationResource. Add all Europeana examples and rationale notes for non-EDM constructs
- use specific EDM-doc properties for "rationale" and "obligation and occurrence". Use skos:definition for "Europeana definition", skos:example for "Example", skos:note for "Europeana note"
