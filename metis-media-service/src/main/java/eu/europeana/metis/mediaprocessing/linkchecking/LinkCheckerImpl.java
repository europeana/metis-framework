/**
 * This class performs link checking.
 * 
 * Note: previously it was implemented by first trying a HEAD request, and only if that fails do we
 * do a GET. The thinking was probably that a HEAD is typically faster than a GET. However, since we
 * are not downloading any content it may be more accurate (at the cost of probably only a small
 * delay) to do the GET request right away: this is after all what the link represents. In case we
 * wish to introduce the HEAD request again, the solution would be to maintain two versions of the
 * LinkCheckClient: one that does HEAD requests, and one that does GET requests.
