  /**
   * This utility method performs breadth-first search through a (directed) graph to search all
   * nodes that are within a certain distance of the source node. Each node consists of a key (that
   * can be used as a key in the {@link Map} interface) and a value. And each node contains
   * references to its neighbors (outgoing edges).
   *
   * @param sourceNodeKey The key of the source node.
   * @param sourceNodeValue The value of the source node.
   * @param maxDistance The maximum distance that we search. If this is less or equal to 0, only the
   * source node will be returned.
   * @param valueResolver A function that obtains a value for a given key. The function could return
   * null.
   * @param neighborExtractor A function that accepts two parameters: a value and a set of keys. The
   * function extracts all neighbors (keys) from the provided value and adds them to the set of
   * keys.
   * @param <K> The type of the node keys.
   * @param <V> The type of the node values.
   * @return The values that are within the specified distance from the source node, including the
   * source node itself.
